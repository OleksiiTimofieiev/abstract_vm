Core:
-  AbstractVM is a machine that uses a stack to compute simple arithmetic expressions. These arithmetic expressions are provided to the machine as basic assembly programs.

Tech:
- https://dzone.com/articles/some-useful-facts-to-know-when-using-c-exceptions
- line validity function (line, type: lexical / syntax / etc.); <- if not match -> invalid line; consider ;; as a command;
- in the end of the command there can be any amount of the spaces;
- general header for all classes, defines, etc;
- refactor guru;
- array passed by reference for the parser after the matching case with regex;
