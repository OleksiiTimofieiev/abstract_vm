Core:
-  AbstractVM is a machine that uses a stack to compute simple arithmetic expressions. These arithmetic expressions are provided to the machine as basic assembly programs.

Tech:
- getline with file and console input (how this works);
- while (TRUE) <- use bool;
- switch case();
- inherit from the std::exceptions;
- template class -> https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/257589/An-Idiots-Guide-to-Cplusplus-Templates-Part-1 / https://code-live.ru/post/cpp-templates-part-2/;
- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/247245/a-vector-of-pointers-to-different-derived-classes-of-the-same-base-class
- conversion through a string;
- use templates;
- stoi / stof / stod;
- git ignore;
- ali makefile;

- read this stuff -> https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/363338/Factory-Pattern-in-Cplusplus;
- For non commutative operations, consider the stack v1 on v2 on
stack_tail, the calculation in infix notation v2 op v1.

- inherit from the stack class and add some features;
- factory method c++;
- error management in correction form;
- vector can be used, use as the type -> interface;
- regex;
- Factory class, 5 private, uno public
- Class which works with exception
- virtual methods ->() + & (passing by reference) 
- array of strings;q
